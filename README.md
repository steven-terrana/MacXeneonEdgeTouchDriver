# Mac Xeneon Edge Touch Driver

A from-scratch macOS user-space touch driver for the Corsair Xeneon Edge 14.5 inch 32:9 touchscreen panel so you can make it genuinely useful when using it with a Mac.

## How To Install

To install for the current user, just run the following from the root of the checked out repository on the relevant mac:

```sh
./Scripts/install.sh
```

This builds the release binary, installs it under:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/MacXeneonEdgeTouchDriver/bin/MacXeneonEdgeTouchDriver
```

and installs the LaunchAgent at:

```text
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ajvwhite.MacXeneonEdgeTouchDriver.plist
```

No script uses `sudo`. Driver logs are written to:

```text
~/Library/Logs/MacXeneonEdgeTouchDriver/driver.log
```

The LaunchAgent also creates `stdout.log` and `stderr.log` in the same directory for process-level output. The driver itself uses Unified Logging plus `driver.log`, so stdout and stderr are normally empty unless launchd or a lower-level runtime writes there.

The installer creates a default config file if one does not already exist:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/MacXeneonEdgeTouchDriver/config.json
```

Uninstall:

```sh
./Scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Uninstall removes the LaunchAgent and Application Support files but keeps logs.

Build a signed release binary:

```sh
./Scripts/build-release.sh
```

By default this uses ad-hoc signing. Set `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` for Developer ID signing and `NOTARIZATION_PROFILE` to submit the release archive with `xcrun notarytool`.

## Configuration

Optional config file:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/MacXeneonEdgeTouchDriver/config.json
```

All fields are optional. Missing or malformed config falls back to defaults and logs a warning.
`logLevel` only controls the minimum level written to `driver.log`; Unified Logging remains controlled by macOS logging configuration.

```json
{
  "logLevel": "info",
  "timing": {
    "warpToClickDelayMs": 10,
    "downToUpDelayMs": 20,
    "clickToWarpBackDelayMs": 10,
    "tapDebounceMs": 50,
    "stuckGestureTimeoutMs": 2000
  },
  "display": {
    "vendorNumber": 3672,
    "modelNumber": 60672,
    "serialNumber": null,
    "expectedWidth": 2560,
    "expectedHeight": 720
  },
  "gesture": {
    "multiTouchEnabled": false
  },
  "diagnostics": {
    "fileLogPath": "/Users/ajvwhite/Library/Logs/MacXeneonEdgeTouchDriver/driver.log",
    "fileLogMaxBytes": 5242880
  }
}
```

`gesture.multiTouchEnabled` is always forced to `false` as the hardware only exposes single touch information, if this ever changes we will look to see how to support multi-touch gestures.

## Known Caveats

- If the physical mouse is moved during a touch gesture, the cursor will return to the position captured when the touch began.
- Multi-contact gestures are not supported as the hardware doesn't report this information back.
- If the process is killed with `SIGKILL`, normal shutdown cleanup cannot run. Relaunching the driver or moving the physical mouse after cursor association is restored may be needed.

## Inactive Window Click-Through

Before posting a synthetic mouse-down, the driver resolves the accessibility element at the
mapped Xeneon coordinate and makes its owning application/window frontmost. This prevents
macOS from consuming the first touch solely to activate an inactive Chrome kiosk. After the
gesture, the driver restores the exact window that was focused beforehand.

Physical acceptance check:

1. Focus a normal application on the primary display.
2. Tap one card action on the Xeneon exactly once.
3. Confirm the card action occurs and the primary-display window regains focus.
4. Repeat with Open, Complete, Close, Add card, and End run.

If a first tap is still activation-only, inspect `driver.log` for `Target window preparation
was incomplete`. The existing Accessibility permission is required both for synthetic input
and for target-window preparation. The driver waits up to 50 ms for Accessibility to confirm
that the target window is focused before it posts the mouse-down.

## Troubleshooting

- If the driver exits immediately, check Accessibility permission for the exact binary location as provided by the install script.
- If HID open fails, check Input Monitoring permission and confirm no other process has seized the same VID/PID device.
- If taps land on the wrong display, run `swift run DisplayInfo` and adjust the optional display config override.
- For HID investigation, use `swift run HIDDump`; it intentionally runs in non-seize mode and is separate from the production daemon.
